HA has been really good in that and helped with personal issues.,4,"3 years in May - Online Teams. She is a Polish speaker.  She has a lot of referrals for Polish SPs.  The community is very tight.  When one person does well everyone owns it.  She has helped connect people, even across the country.  Tries to maintain and build those relationships.",3,Of all her manager's she had she has trusted the majority of them.  She treats her job as her second family.  Wants to do more for them.,3,Extremely valuable.  We get caught up in routine without realizing when we slip sometimes and we need someone to point out and help us tweak things.  Loves supporting her whole team.  Switched teams in January. Has been able to expand her work family.,4,Medical records shop was poorly managed.  She was running the records department without any training.  The other doctors had stopped relying on the department and she was told to just do it the way it had been done.  Within 6 months she brought them 4 years up to date.  The entire clinic life improved.  She had to learn how to do it on her own and pushed through the doubts to get it done.,4,"Over the phone she has had points of a negative attitude that she's been called out for.  Things outside work from the gym to her daughter, friends all help adjust her attitude.  Recently remodeled half her house by herself.  The creativity is an outlet as well.",4,Running a medical records department for a genius Doctor with no people skills & didn't treat employees with any respect.  Was there a year.  Most grateful for being able to see the type of environment she can work in and appreciate what HA has here.

There wasn't enough demand to get it done, but it was a lot to learn about working with the other departments inside of HA.",2,"Has made mistakes, but doesn't consider them failures.  She has jumped to conclusions too quickly and treated people like they're all the same.  Has learned from that in her approach to people and how to improve her communication.",3,"Being very organized. Great with attendance.  Values her own word, even if it's incovienient. You still have to follow through.  Just trying to be observant & learn as much as possible.",2,"Yeah, very lucky.  Thinks luck is very real and helps things happen in your life.  Did mention that feels lucky because she was adopted at 3mo old and had great parents.",3,"Dealing w/ stress.  Just bringing stress home and being frustrated would reflect on personal relationships.  Sacrifices haven't been worht it.  Acknowledges that her approach was bad, but something to learn from.  Her motivation is from proving to others that you can do it and beat them.  Have confidence so that you can know your value.",3,"SPs understand paying for a lead, but they don't always get it when they lose out on business.  When they lie to your face and make their failure your fault you have to be very calm and respectful to tell them that they are in the wrong and that the screaming/yelling is not the way to make the conversation continue and improve things.  Communication is the key. Also tried to input humor to defuse situations.",2,Enjoys where she is right now.  No plan for 3-5 years yet.

Likes helping the new people who join.,2,At his last job people were dropping like flies.  He stayed around longer than others and had to keep making enough.  Wanted to secure another job first.  He was good at it also.,2,"Last role he had a negative attitude for awhile.  Was hard to keep a positive attitude.  Tries to keep one, but sometimes the chatter around you can bring you down. If he gets to a negative point it's time to leave.  Tries to reset attitude by being thankful & going back to why he came there in the first place.",2,Last role management was terrible.  Was sold on HA because there was no micro-managing.  People not breathing down your neck.  It was a corporate inside sales role.  Employees called it a labor camp.

It got picked up by the company and is still used to this day.  The system and organization was picked up and a great.  Learned that people will listen if you have a voice and want to speak up.  Need to be confident.,4,Failed a few classes in college because she didn't study.  Learned that she isn't going to be handed things and that you have to work for things.  It isn't just handed to you.  You aren't going to just walk into things.,2,"Being in the right frame of mind every single morning.  Committing to a full day of work.

To get through life you need to get it done yourself.  It's based on your efforts.  Don't make poor decisions (coming to work drunk).,4,Being a parent is a sacrifice to make yourself succeed.  You have to sacrifice time or your own desires for your kids.  Crazy to see how much her daughter has learned and grown.  - Money not as big a motivation for her.

More the motivation to just succeed.,4,At Sears she got a lot of negative feedback from customers when they couldn't return items they didn't buy at the store.  Having to deal with angry people face to face was very difficult at times.  Being able to work through aggressive customer behavior s key.  A lady escalated and got into it with her manager.

Making herself push through to be able to stay here.",4,Very relaxed and poised.  Very genuine.  Great connection and personality.,61,68,06/27/2017 10:43:59 am MDT

Making sure that time on the phone is a good use of time.  Bringing on everyone he can.  He's on the Online team.,4,Manager at COX Communications in KS.  Named Tyler who always went to bat for you.  Would let you take care of your personal stuff as long as you were getting the job done.  He'd stop and talk to you personally and try to get you out of a funk when necessary.,3,Extremely important.  Need to learn something new every day.  Being able to look to those around you for support and things you can learn is great.  His wife and manager are a big source of that.  Also is very interested in helping others and feels that he has been able to become a support person for others.,4,"Before he moved from KS his company announced that the call center he was working in was closing.  Ryan was able to still go in and get as much done as he could and ended up putting up some of the best numbers he'd had, while almost everyone else was throwing in the towel.",3,"Happened at his last job, at Zillow.  The company was going through a ton of changes.  They would take groups of people in a room and tell them they were doing terrible and weren't going to be eligible for re-hire.  Morale was extremely low.  He had to take control of his attitude and do the best he could to be able to take care of his family.  The environment though played a big part in his departture.",4,Back before he owned his own company he was building fence for someone else.  He had a manager that constantly ran him into the ground every day and made him tough to think.  From that job though he liked that he had a drive to work harder and industry knowledge.  He later used that knowledge to start his own company.,4,"Last year he started his own music promotion website.  He did interviews with Nightclubs, DJs and other artists around the world.  He gained investors, but it got to a point where the industry and the quality of life it was creating wasn't where he wanted it to go.  He stopped the site late last year because it was taking too much out of him at a time. It had also caused personal struggles with his family.",4,"Failed by having a kid at age 16, and at being a good father to that kid.  It wasn't the best relationship with him that it could have been.  He has tried to turn things around with his kids now.  His first kid is almost 20 years old now and he is still trying to fix that relationship.",4,"Being relentless. In sales, you have to be willing to turn the other cheek and move on to the next call.  Have to have a positive attitude.  If you can't break out of that you should be elsewhere.  Be resilient and tough skinned.  Those are the key areas that have helped his sales career the most.",4,"No, you create your own luck.  You either put yourself there or your actions get you there.",4,"Sacrificed his sales career by starting his company last year. It caused friction with his wife of 17 years.  Next time he would definitely take his family/wife situation more into the decision that gets made.   Outside of money, Recognition really motivates him.  Quality of life is a big motivation factor for him as well.",2,"One big thing is being pushy or overbearing.  He tries to help change the voice of the action.  You need to push for the second or third no, but also be constantly reevaluating.  After sales at HA he's had very little to no pushback from customers so far.  He tries to set correct expectations and won't bend the truth to get people to sign up.",3,Would like to consistently be making 100-120k every year at HA.

Previously worked in a place that was very strict, where he had to clock in, and wouldn't let you check your cell, etc.  It's one of the reasons he moved to HA.",3,Started in October.  Started on the Market team.  Day-to-day was solely focused on new opportunities and new customers.  Has transferred now into a customer care role (this week).  Now he is trying to increase retention and make sure customers are having a good experience.  Driving value home to the customers.  Moving forward he would like to continue learning new things to be as well rounded as possible.  Today is his second day out of training.,4,Was a lead generator at a Home Depot store.  Had a manager named John Gray who took an interest in his life outside of work.  He was really involved and became a friend.  Was interested in him as a person and not just employee.  Experienced that multiple times at HA as well.,4,"Very valuable.  Actually, has someone who is somewhat of a mentor in his life professionally.  Someone who has the same interests and values as him and has had success in his life.  He has provided a great resource on career and life in general.  Someone with a 3rd party perspective.  He has also connected himself into others support systems.  Has had a lot of experiences in his own time that he likes to be able to share with others.  Was great to do that in his Customer Care training class.",2,"At HA, in sales, his numbers weren't where they needed to be and he didn't want to give up.  Even his wife questioned where he was at.  He's struggled with following through in the past.  It felt good to make sure he didn't cut and run and found a way to make the right move and have a role that provides value to the company.",3,"Worked for Tentacle Structural Services - attitude in sales wasn't great because the transition wasn't occurring as quickly as possible.  He also didn't agree with all the business practices there.  Still kept things professional, but it affected his attitude.",2,The worst would be the last situation he was in.  A lot of promises were made when he was hired but weren't followed through on.  Work was also very hard.  Once things weren't followed through on it started becoming a bad job to have and his attitude went downhill.  Was most grateful for the relationships that he established with the crew he was working with.  Learned a lot about the guys he worked with and their culture and how they stayed happy all the time.,2,"He's had thoughts about starting his own contracting business.  Has done a lot of research, but doesn't see it happening in the near future.  He does stay connected in that field with his career and connected to the environment.  Continuing to learn on the side and bouncing ideas.  Hasn't run with it.",3,"When he initially went to college he went to school but wasn't engaged.  He ended up dropping out.   He learned not to jump into something just because it's what everyone is doing.  Don't make a decision, just because everyone expects that to happen.",3,"If I have made a mistake, don't hesitate to open your mouth and take ownership.  Also, taking interest in his co-workers, managers, etc.  Being personable with others.",2,"Does think luck is real.  He is lucky, but not sure if it's always good luck.  There is fate & chance in anything.  Thinks he is not more often lucky than good, but would like to be.",3,"Hasn't made any huge sacrifices.  The big one so far has been time.  He's working extra hours and doing things at home at night to make him more successful, like writing up his own scripts.  He feels like the time has been worth it and he's in a good situation now.",3,"In his last 2 days, he's already started hearing about negative interactions between SPs & homeowners.  When talking to a customer you have to acknowledge they went through an unfortunate situation & explain why it might have happened, and then assure them that we're there to help them, and then try to find a solution to the issue.  Don't match them in the anger.  Help them de-escalate.",2,Just moved into a new role this week.

There may be times to go in early or work late to be a top performer. Has to be personal life balance as well.  May need time off with kids.  Looked for ebb/flow in an employer.,4,"Has been there 1 year & 8 months.  Would provide feedback for current role, where she's at & has been with other organizations.  Has been working with HA on Lean management or 6 Sigma.  Came from Liberty Mutual & previously a government contractor.  Those were much more organized environments.  Thinks it could help the organization and building out improvements.  Not in the role currently able to look at the big picture from a CEO standpoint.  Looking at it from her level and aspirations to be a leader in the organization.  Thinks something like Six Sigma/LEAN would help the overall picture.",4,"When you trust your peers & direct leader you're more vested.  Not only in the company & team, but also in your leader.  Her latest manager she knew she could talk to about anything without any judgment.  When you have the trust of your colleagues you're more productive & doing what's right and best for the company.  The relationship is imperative.",4,"The value of mentors is huge. Cannot better yourself without development.  Usually, that comes from someone you trust, like a mentor.  100% needed for her.  The way she knows she has a valuable mentor & someone she can trust, is someone you want to always be honest and open with you.  You know through communication and how that person makes you feel.",4,"Her personality.  She doesn't give up.  It's all about attitude.  You have to keep a positive attitude.  Have to get back up every time.  That comes through learning experiences.  It's her job, even as a peer, if she sees someone sluffing off, to help keep everyone up and motivated.  You always have to be on here.  You need a personality that doesn't give up.  If on the 14er you may hurt you can take breaks, but keep going.  You can't feel the highs unless you feel the lows as well.",4,"100% - We're all human. Things bother us or we have a bad day.  May miss commission one day... but changing your perspective.  Taking a walk, going to a mentor are great ways to help.  Don't spread negativity to others though!  Sometimes wears her heart on her sleeve... but wants to help colleagues.",4,Has been happy with most of her jobs.  Least favorite job would have been being an Administrative Assistant.  She didn't like working for one person & just sitting at the PC all day.  Wanted to be around people.  Grateful that she made good money and everything that she learned.,4,Once she becomes a leader with HA she really wants to pursue Six Sigma/Lean.  She's created documents.  She's also trying to be a manager candidate and has been creating some contests.  Helping to create camaraderie and competition.  Playing Battleship on teams.  When people submit a sale they get to request a hit & whoever wins the game moves on to the next round.  Winner of the tournament gets $500.,4,"She fails every single day.  She likes to set really high goals.  Specifically, (this is a sore one) she had a presentation 2 weeks ago.  Thinks she nailed it.  She showed a video, did a presentation, then was going to do a closing video. 
 It wasn't playing, so she Googled inspirational speeches and showed a closing video...  and ended up showing a video that was not appropriate for work and was overly political.  She should have stopped the video, but she let it run and had to fall on her sword.  It showed others she was human.",4,"Yoga is huge for her personally.  Professionally she's a black belt in Six Sigma, which has helped her to look at the big picture.  Can't get stuck in the weeds.  Through books and webinars and apps she continues to try and develop herself every day.",4,"No, believes in hard work and thinks that when you perform and put in the time you continue to be successful.  You have to keep learning about yourself and others.  You have to work hard to directly correlate to success.  Was one of the top people in the company last year.  Had never been in sales before.  Now in sales because of hard work she's earned her way.",4,"Her current position she's made sacrifices, going back to work/life balance.  Professional sacrifices are for the betterment of herself which directly affects her family, which also helps the company as a whole.  Work/Life balance is a sacrifice helps both family & company.  She will never sacrifice core values, like integrity.  Sacrifice is important since it makes you open to change to flexibility.",4,Today she saved an account that had very negative feedback about HA & about her.  Guy hadn't won any jobs yet.  It's his livelihood.  Any feedback you get you have to listen.  You have to let them talk & be solution-minded.  Don't cut people off.  Meet them half way and find out what can you do.  Today she changed the type to commercial instead of residential and test it for a week or so.  Find a solution somewhere.,4,Very goal oriented.  Does a vision board every year.  3-5 yr plan is to be a leader within HA.  Wants to be able to learn about and motivate 14 personalities.  Wants to be able to be the best she can and continue to learn and develop.  Wants to continue to carry a positive attitude forward as well.,,,,,,,,,56,72,06/13/2017 3:06:03 pm MDT

Started out as a Market rep, has been an online rep.  Helped with the new targets of Sr Care, Photography, etc.  Has been a manager as well in that area.  Built it from 1-2 reps up to 12.

Went to Wells Fargo for 1.5 years and just went back as a rep.",4,Had a mgr named Jim Croft who was VP of Sales.  He mentored him as a mgr and as a man/father.  Lost his dad in 1999.  Was a great experience and prepared him to be able to help and lead others.,4,Very important!  He's been mentored by a VP of Sales and has taught other men and helped mentor them. A guy on his team was getting a divorce and he helped him out with some issues and mentored him as well.  Able to help many others.,4,"Have to figure out how fast you can fail.  Fail fast can equal success.  Agendas at work they weren't selling well, then did more research and held lunch and learn about new research and develop the rallying cry.  Still took time, but improved.",4,"As a human, you always suffer negative things.  As you get older and get more mature you have to leave problems at the door otherwise you have two problems.  Was an athlete and able to be coached.  Utilize all those tools.",4,"As a 21yr old he wanted to be a DJ at a club.  Went to the club and told them he wanted to do it, buut had no experience.  He was hired and did it for 2 days then quit because it didn't fit his lifestyle.  Grateful that he learned he wanted to be in a more professional environment.",4,"As a Mgr he was looking at prospecting new clientele at HA.  He's not the best technical person, so it's important to share the info and get feedback from others.  Can't put a WR on the offensive line.  Utilized teammates to bounce ideas.  Had to get the right players in the right places.",-1,,4,Mindset is big.  Helps him to deal with disappointment a lot better.  Use to bank on 1-2 ppl to sign up and it would ruin his day/week very quickly.  Had to develop that to improve drastically.,3,"Doesn't think he is a lucky person.  Thinks luck is out there, but it's where time and space meet from your own efforts.  Your effort can drive luck.  You have to put in the effort for it to happen though.",4,"Had to spend time away from his 2 kids.  He's worked 6 days a week.  To be #1 in the company that can come at the cost of time with your children.  It's been worth it since he's been able to provide, but also sees his kids growing up quick - has to have balance.",4,It's a part of every job.  Can't make everyone happy.  You need to be an extremely good listener.  Listening is a skill that people don't have as much anymore.  Need to listen to exactly the problem and come up with a solution.,4,Would like to be a Sales Director for HA again.  Has been a Sales Manager for 4 years.

When you're at work you must be present and give your time and energy for work.  Nice thing at HA is that you can leave work at work and not take it home with you.",3,"Has been at HA for 5 years.  She would like to continue to do as well as she has the last few years.  The first couple years she had to help find her ground, but the last few years has been doing better.  She was able to get a good internal support system and internal mentors.  Leaning on mentors here can definitely help.  Tries to be consistent and keep her SP's happy.  Being coachable is key to success here.",4,Has been through a few managers at HA.  Most recent was one that did bring her to the top.  They built a friendship and had mutual trust and respect.  Was very supportive of her and the team and would help anyone.  Would really listen and then jump to action.,3,Very important for her.  She's independent but loves having people who are there for her.  She likes to get input & advice from others. Feels like she's a part of others support as well... sometimes too much.  Gives a lot of time & energy and focus on what they need & not always on what she needs.,4,"Can't think of one initially... knows there are plenty.  Initially thought I was asking if the people had given up on her.  A few times a year she does a mind/body cleanse that is really hard.  Not eating any food for about 10 days, but drinking a replacement.  Almost everyone she's done it with have dropped out of it, but she always sticks through it.  In 2005 when she first did it she saw some amazing results so she knows that afterward the results were there and she felt amazing.",4,"Everyone goes through that in sales, because it can be so up and down.  When her sales aren't where they should be, she can get into a bit of a funk and her attitude can sometimes slip and not be as positive as she would like or they would like.  Meeting with teammates, manager, director, etc can help boost confidence and her attitude and being positive and not letting the slump get her down.  Even people around you can sometimes be the ones to drag you down.  Your support system, a few sales, or even a break is a great way to change the situation.",4,"Has taken something from all of her jobs, so not sure they are the worst.  The first job at 16 was at a CD store. What made it the worst was the monotony of it.  Not a lot of flexibility. Run by a guy who enforced tons of rules and guidelines.  Likes people who are a little more flexible.  Job was boring.  Not a lot of people who came through the doors. Loves music though. Was grateful for someone to hold her accountable, someone to report to, and learning to follow-through and not let people down.  Learned a lot of responsibility.",4,"Something she'd wanted to do on the side of work was animal therapy.  Loves horses and grew up riding her whole life.  Wanted to bring horses back into her life.  Found a company that took horses to homes of cancer patients to cheer them up for the day.  Child/Adult would groom them, go for a short ride, etc.  She was very excited about working with her dad about it.  She contacted the company in MI and was involved here to find materials for the program and contacting ranches, etc.  Lots of research, networking, etc.  She hasn't had the time recently to continue pursuing.",4,"Contest at HA every quarter called President's Club.  Last year it was her goal, but she finished 1 away.  Her retention rate fell just shy by less than a percent.  She was really bummed, but when it came down to it she'd just barely missed it.  She learned from that and learned to stay on top of her numbers and how to do that better.  She hadn't paid close enough attention to her retention rate.",4,Recognizing the importance of being responsible and following through.  Having people hold her accountable have helped her stay on top of things and wanting to succeed.  Needs to stay on top of her game to maintain success.  Communication is key.  Asking for support when you need it.  Setting expectations.  Learning from mistakes and not letting others distract you.  Going to always be haters.,2,"Yes & No.  Feels lucky & blessed with the situation/environment that she works in. Very flexible & allows you to be yourself.  Thinks fortunate is a better word.  Has had good managers who have supported her.  She is a pretty superstitious person outside of work, but after I prompted her she said that she feels that you do have to create your own luck... but fortunate for the opportunity to do it.",4,"Everybody wants to find a job and a place where they can be passionate day in and day out.  Growing up she always wanted to be a horse trainer, but at the end of the day it didn't pay the bills.  She was a teacher before HomeAdvisor, but a lot of the time and energy she wasn't feeling that it was being reciprocated.  We switched over to HA and believing in the product and what you do day in and day out helps you with finding that passion again.  She did give up the horse training but found something else that was helping people to succeed.  Giving up the childhood passion was tough.  Found something else that she was passionate.",3,She feels like she's transparent.  What you see/hear is what you get.  She likes to set expectations up front correctly.  Tries to work with SPs who have issues from herself directly and where any miscommunication may have come from.  Tries to get on the same page and if needed pulls in support of her manager.  Tries to get on a good note with the SP.,3,"No plan.  Likes where she is at right now, but taking it day by day.  She wants to start a family someday, but still wants to stay at HA while she was it.

Would bring it up to his manager/chain-of-command.,2,"Trust is a strong word for him.  Didn't have any initially that he thought of.  Was in Marines and has worked multiple jobs.  Can bring issues to his current manager.  Likes that his current manager is willing to work and fight for you.   Feels like he's earned his manager's trust as well.  Has missed some time lately since truck was messed up, but still came in when he could and his manager appreciated that.",3,"Very important.

He wanted to quit (at HA), because he wasn't getting the results he felt he should have for the work he was putting in.  That was a month ago.

Since then his attitude has improved.,3,Warehouse job.  Late hours (would get home at 4am).  Worked freezer core.  Learned all the positions. Pay was low. Manageent wasn't there.  Most grateful that he learned that you can't change what everyone else is doing and that he needed to make sure he was still doing his job the right way.  Recognition is big for him.,1,Believes in place & time thing. He's on the fly most of the time.  Wants to just jump on it.  People told him about HA for months.

Had heard about HA 3-4 times in the 3 months before he started working there.,3,"Fresh out of the military and was trying to get a job at Lowes.

Believes in circumstances.  Up to you to reach out and grab it or not.,2,"Tough question.  Not too passionate about too many things.  Military right after school, but was super passionate about sports.  Has had two knee surgeries though.  I asked him about the move from FL to CO and he was able to explain about the difficulties of moving into someone's house in CO and how he had to move away from family and into someone else's home in CO initially and all the drama that was there.",4,"He hasn't had any big issues at HA.  It's primarily been people who speak to him about hearsay of HA and talk about HA ""scamming"" people or getting bad reviews.  He tries to talk to them about the fact that they have 160k contractors that currently use them and they only have 500 bad reviews online, so it's less than 1% of reviews that are poor.  He tries to talk SP's through it and to help them understand that it's up to them to be successful.",1,Trying to figure that out right now.  I then asked him about HA specifically and he really wants to get HA to be more consistent.  Wants to give HA at least 6 more months.
